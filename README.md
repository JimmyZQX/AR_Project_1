# AR Jam

Welcome to AR Jam, an Oculus Quest augmented reality software for playing keyboard-based musical instruments and collaborating with other musicians. 

# Introduction
AR Jam is an Augmented Reality built for instrumental playing and collaboration. To try it out, first download the newest build from the headset_builds folder and use SideQuest to sideload the file onto your Oculus Quest (1 or 2) headset. Then, connect a MIDI keyboard to your computer. 
You will then need to run the Python file OSC-client in the pc_interface directory, and run AR Jam on the headset at the same time. The Python file will ask which instrument you would like to choose. After making a decision, simply wear your headset, play something on the keyboard, interact with the virtual controls, and enjoy the game!
